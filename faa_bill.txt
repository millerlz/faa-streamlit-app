greatest extent practicable, properly docketed ex

20

in order to—

21
22
23
24

(i) inform the work of the Administrator;
(ii) assist the Administrator in developing the scope of a rule; and

MUR24332 HT0

56
(iii) reduce the timeline for issuance

1
2

of proposed and final rules;

3

(B) rely on documented data and safety

4

trends when determining whether or not to pro-

5

ceed with a rulemaking activity; and

6

(C) not consider a rulemaking activity re-

7

quired in statute, for the purposes of ex parte

8

communications, as having been established on

9

the date of enactment of the related public law,

10

but rather upon obtainment of a regulation

11

identifier number; and

12

(2) when it would reduce the time required for

13

the Administrator to adjudicate public comments,

14

the Administrator should publicly provide informa-

15

tion describing the rationale behind a regulatory de-

16

cision included in proposed regulations in order to

17

better allow for the public to provide clear and in-

18

formed comments on such regulations.

21

under sections 47113 and 47107(e) of title 49,

related barriers continue to pose significant obstacles

to do business in airport-related markets across the

Nation.

ports, reports issued by public and private agencies,

8

news stories, reports of discrimination by organiza-

Such testimony and documentation show that race-

11

and gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to

address the problem.

(3) The testimony and documentation described

ness owners and minority business owners in the ra-

18

cial groups detailed in parts 23 and 26 of title 49,

20

development and other aspects of airport-related

business in the public and private markets.
